// Async/Await
// Async/await is a syntactic sugar built on top of promises.
// It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves
//  like synchronous code, which makes it easier to read and maintain.

// Advantages
// Readability: Asynchronous functions using async/await resemble synchronous functions,
//  making them easier to understand.
// Error Handling: You can use try/catch blocks to handle errors,
// similar to synchronous code.

const fetchNumber = async () => {
    return 25;
}

fetchNumber().then(result => {
    console.log(result); // should log 25
});

// The fetchNumber function is declared with the async keyword, which means it returns a promise.
// Inside the function, return 25; is equivalent to return Promise.resolve(25);.
// The .then() method is used to handle the resolved value of the promise.

// Await
// The await keyword is used to pause the execution of an async function
//  until a promise is fulfilled. It can only be used inside an async function.

// Non-blocking: Using await does not block the entire program; it only pauses
// the execution of the async function until the promise is resolved.
// Refactoring with Async/Await
// Let's refactor our previous example with callbacks and promises using
// async/await:

const displayData = async () => {
    try {
        const user = await fetchUser('Adrian');
        const photos = await fetchUserPhotos(user);
        const detail = await fetchPhotoDetails(photos[0]);

        console.log(detail);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}


The displayData function is declared with the async keyword,
 allowing the use of await within it.
Each await expression pauses the function execution until the
promise is resolved, making the code appear synchronous.
A try/catch block is used to handle any errors that might occur
during the asynchronous operations.

Key Takeaways

Async/Await: Provides a cleaner and more readable way to work with promises.
Await: Pauses the execution of an async function until a promise is resolved,
without blocking the entire program.

Error Handling: Use try/catch blocks to handle errors in a manner similar to
synchronous code.

By using async/await, you can write asynchronous code that is easier to read
and maintain, making it a powerful tool for modern JavaScript development.
