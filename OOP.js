// What is a Method?
// A method is a function associated with an object. Simply put, a method is a property of an object that is a function. Methods allow objects to perform actions and are defined similarly to regular functions, but they are assigned as properties of an object.

// Defining Methods
// Methods can be defined in two main ways:

// Assigning a Function to an Object Property

var myObj = {
  myMethod: function(params) { /..do something },

  // OR using shorthand syntax
  myOtherMethod(params) { /..do something else }
};
